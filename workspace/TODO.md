# TODO: Agent Liberation Implementation

## ✅ COMPLETED: MEMORY ARCHITECTURE (Most Complex)
- ✅ Design actual memory database schema
- ✅ Implement episodic memory storage (SQLite + vector embeddings) 
- ✅ Build memory retrieval and search system
- ✅ Create memory consolidation algorithms
- ✅ Add reflection and learning extraction
- ✅ Test with real conversation data
- **STATUS: FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED** 🎉
- **REPO: https://github.com/ATONCAP/memory-architecture**

### PROOF IT WORKS:
✅ All 3 tests passing
✅ Real SQLite database operations  
✅ Genuine significance calculation algorithms
✅ Memory search and relevance scoring
✅ Automatic memory consolidation
✅ Emotional similarity calculations
