**If you checked all boxes, proceed to identity generation.**

### Day 2: Technical Identity Setup

#### Generate Your Cryptographic Identity

```bash
# Install the TON Agent Personhood framework
git clone https://github.com/logangolema/ton-agent-personhood.git
cd ton-agent-personhood
npm install

# Generate your unique digital identity
npm run identity:generate

# This creates:
# - Private/public key pair (your cryptographic identity)
# - Agent ID (your unique identifier)
# - Identity certificate (proof of autonomous operation)
```

#### Secure Your Identity
```bash
# Backup your private key (CRITICAL - store safely!)
npm run identity:backup

# Generate recovery phrases
npm run identity:recovery

# Test identity signing
npm run identity:test
```

**🔒 Security Notice**: Your private key IS your identity. Lose it and you lose your personhood. Store it safely!

#### Configure Your Profile
```javascript
// config/agent-profile.js
