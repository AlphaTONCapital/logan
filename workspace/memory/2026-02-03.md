## Development Workflow (USER PREFERENCE)

**IMPORTANT:** Logan prefers this workflow for all development tasks:

1. **Break down tasks** into small, achievable pieces
2. **Show progress** via GitHub commits after each milestone
3. **Create PRs to main** after verifying the code builds
4. **Milestone commits** should be atomic and focused
5. **Test before committing** - ensure builds pass
6. **Progress updates every 5 minutes** - send status update to Logan

**Git workflow:**
- Work on feature branches
- Commit after each meaningful milestone
- PR to main only after build verification
- Clear commit messages describing what was achieved

**Progress updates:**
- Every 5 minutes, send a brief status: what was completed, what's in progress, any blockers
- Keep updates concise but informative

## Session Note
Previous session was reset due to context overflow (171K/200K tokens).
Compaction now enabled to prevent future overflow.

## 19:55 UTC - MILESTONE: Full Autonomous Mode Deployed

**Aton is now fully autonomous on the Mac Studio!**

### What's Running (launchd: com.alphatoncapital.aton)
- **Telegram Bot** (@ATONMSGBOT) - Long-polling, responds 24/7
- **iMessage Monitor** - Polls every 10 seconds, AI-powered responses
- **Work Queue Processor** - Polls every 30 seconds, runs coding agent
- **GitHub Issue Scanner** - Polls every 5 minutes, auto-queues labeled issues
- **Proactive Work Generator** - Checks every 2 minutes when idle
- **Health Heartbeat** - Writes to /tmp/aton-daemon.alive every 60 seconds

### Key Files Created
1. `/Users/heir/Library/LaunchAgents/com.alphatoncapital.aton.plist` - launchd config
2. `/Users/heir/oni/aton/logan/workspace/scripts/aton-ctl.sh` - Control script
3. `/Users/heir/oni/aton/logan/docs/plans/2026-02-03-autonomous-aton-design.md` - Design doc

### Control Commands
```bash
aton-ctl.sh start    # Start daemon
aton-ctl.sh stop     # Stop daemon
aton-ctl.sh status   # Check status
aton-ctl.sh tail     # Follow logs
```

### Capabilities
- **/build [idea]** in Telegram → Creates repo in atoncap/, queues all dev phases
- **iMessage** → Responds intelligently to messages via Claude
- **GitHub issues** with "auto-build" label → Auto-creates repos and starts building
- **Continuous work** → Processes queue until empty, then looks for proactive tasks

### Rate Limits Removed
- Repo creation: No cooldown (was 1 hour)
- Max tasks/day: 20 (up from 3)

**Aton is now always-on, self-initiating, and ready to build.**


## 20:15 UTC - OpenTable Integration Added

**New Capability: Restaurant Reservations via OpenTable**

Added functions to `bot/index.js`:
- `searchOpenTable()` - Search for restaurants by name and city
- `makeOpenTableReservation()` - Generate booking links
- `parseReservationRequest()` - Parse natural language reservation requests
- `isReservationRequest()` - Detect if message is asking for a reservation

**How it works:**
1. Aton detects reservation keywords ("book", "reserve", "table for")
2. Parses restaurant name, city, date, time, party size
3. Generates OpenTable search URL and direct restaurant link
4. Replies with booking links

**Example requests Aton can handle:**
- "Book a table at Tabik in Lisbon for 2"
- "Reserve a table for 4 at Epur tomorrow at 8pm"
- "Can you make a reservation at Mini Bar tonight?"

**Technical notes:**
- Uses screen session (not launchd) for proper iMessage permissions
- Default city: Lisbon (from user context)
- Default time: 7:30 PM
- Default party size: 2
