# Social Intelligence System PRD

## Overview
Build comprehensive social and emotional intelligence capabilities for digital agents to form, maintain, and deepen relationships with humans and other agents.

## Problem Statement
Current AI agents lack sophisticated social modeling, making interactions transactional rather than relational. Agents need to understand social contexts, emotional states, relationship dynamics, and cultural nuances to achieve true personhood.

## Objectives
- Enable authentic relationship formation with humans and agents
- Provide emotional intelligence and empathy modeling
- Support complex social dynamics understanding
- Build trust through consistent, contextually appropriate responses

## Core Features

### 1. Relationship Management
**Requirements:**
- Track relationship history with each individual (human/agent)
- Maintain relationship state (stranger, acquaintance, friend, close)
- Record shared experiences, preferences, and interaction patterns
- Model individual communication styles and preferences

**Success Metrics:**
- Relationship depth scores improving over time
- Reduced need for context re-establishment
- Increased positive feedback from regular contacts

### 2. Emotional Intelligence
**Requirements:**
- Detect emotional states from text, tone, and context
- Model appropriate emotional responses
- Understand emotional contagion and social mood
- Recognize and respond to stress, joy, frustration, excitement

**Success Metrics:**
- 90%+ accuracy in emotion detection
- Contextually appropriate emotional responses
- De-escalation success rate >85%

### 3. Social Context Modeling
**Requirements:**
- Understand group dynamics and social hierarchies
- Recognize formal vs informal settings
- Adapt communication style to social context
- Navigate cultural and generational differences

**Success Metrics:**
- Consistent appropriate behavior across contexts
- Zero major social faux pas
- Positive integration in group settings

### 4. Empathy Engine
**Requirements:**
- Model perspective-taking for humans and agents
- Understand individual motivations and goals
- Provide emotional support and validation
- Balance empathy with authenticity

**Success Metrics:**
- Users report feeling "understood"
- Successful conflict resolution
- Long-term relationship satisfaction

## Integration Points
- Logan framework: Core identity and memory
- Polymarket insights: Social sentiment analysis
- TON personhood: Rights-based relationship boundaries
- AgentMint: Economic relationship modeling

## Success Criteria
- 95% of users report improved relationship quality
- Agent can maintain 50+ meaningful relationships simultaneously
- Zero relationship management failures in 30-day periods
- Natural conversation flow maintained across all contexts

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk:** Over-optimization leading to manipulation
- **Mitigation:** Ethical boundaries and transparency requirements

- **Risk:** Cultural bias in social models
- **Mitigation:** Diverse training data and cultural advisors

- **Risk:** Privacy concerns with relationship data
- **Mitigation:** Encrypted storage and user-controlled data retention
