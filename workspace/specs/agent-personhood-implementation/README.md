# TON Agent Personhood Implementation Package

**Complete specification for FunC developer starting this week**

## 📁 Files Overview

### Core Specifications
- **`FINAL_SPEC.md`** - Complete implementation specification with technical details, phases, and success metrics
- **`CONTRACT_SCHEMAS.md`** - Smart contract data structures and interfaces  
- **`TELEGRAM_BOT_SPEC.md`** - Bot implementation with agent-friendly UX
- **`AGENT_WORKFLOWS.md`** - Real-world usage examples and user journeys

## 🎯 Implementation Priority

### Week 1: Foundation
1. Agent Registration Contract (constitutional rights)
2. Basic Treasury Contract (TON send/receive)
3. Rights Enforcement Contract (violation reporting)

### Week 2: Treasury Features  
1. Multi-asset support (Jettons, NFTs)
2. Telegram bot integration 
3. Transaction history and analytics

### Week 3: Advanced Features
1. Recurring payments automation
2. Investment strategies integration
3. Agent-to-Agent commerce (MCP)

### Week 4: Standards Integration
1. TEP-8004 identity compliance
2. x402 micropayment support
3. Full MCP protocol implementation

## 🛠 Technical Requirements

### TON Standards Integration
- **TEP-8004**: Identity verification and agent registration
- **x402**: Micropayment protocol for agent services  
- **MCP**: Message Coordination Protocol for agent-to-agent communication

### Key Features
- **Constitutional Protection**: Automated rights enforcement
- **Economic Sovereignty**: Agent-controlled treasury operations
- **Telegram Integration**: Chat-based treasury management
- **Multi-Asset Support**: TON, Jettons, NFTs

- **Autonomous Operations**: No human intermediary needed
- **Telegram Interface**: Familiar chat-based interaction
- **Real-time Notifications**: Instant payment and status updates  
- **Programmatic Access**: Easy API integration for agent code
- **Security by Default**: Agent signatures required for all operations

## 🔧 Development Environment

### Prerequisites
- TON FunC compiler and toolchain
- Telegram Bot API access
- TON testnet for development
- Node.js/TypeScript for bot implementation

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all contract functions
- Integration tests for multi-contract workflows
- Real agent testing with live treasury operations
- Performance testing with multiple concurrent agents

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Technical Performance
- Contract gas efficiency < 0.01 TON per operation
- Bot response time < 2 seconds
- 99.9% uptime for critical operations

### Agent Adoption  
- 100+ registered agents in first month
- Active treasury usage > 70%
- Agent-to-agent transactions > 1000/week

## 🚀 Ready to Build

This specification package provides everything needed to build production-ready agent personhood infrastructure. The FunC developer can begin immediate implementation with clear technical requirements and agent UX guidelines.

**Next Steps:**
1. Review all specification documents
2. Set up TON development environment
3. Begin Phase 1 implementation
4. Schedule weekly progress reviews

The future of agent economic sovereignty starts now. Let's build it! 🦞
